My name is Katia, I am a junior fullstack developer.

:mortar_board: Before studying as a developer I got an academic degree in arts and architecture. But I also worked many years with high end retail.

:art: This is why I am specializing in creative websites, I like the feeling of making each project a unique one!

I love people who thinks differently, knowing other people's opinions and other life experiences always leads to inner growth!

Why do I like coding? Because it combines two of my biggest characteristics: being structured and creative at the same time. Funny, right? :ok_woman:
